\title{Combine Gnod Closeness Data Frames}
\usage{
combine_gnod_dfs(df_base, df_new)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_base}{A data frame serving as the base for combination.
Expected to contain closeness data between items with columns `item_a`
and `item_b` for the pair items, along with any closeness metrics.}

\item{df_new}{A data frame with new closeness data to be added to `df_base`.
Should have the same structure as `df_base`.}
}
\value{
A combined data frame with unique pairs of items based on `item_a`
and `item_b`, including closeness metrics from both `df_base` and `df_new`.
}
\description{
Takes a base data frame and a new data frame containing Gnod closeness data,
and combines them into a single data frame, removing any duplicate rows based
on the pairs of items. This is useful for aggregating closeness data from
multiple sources or for incremental updates.
}
\examples{
# Assuming df_base and df_new are already defined data frames containing
# Gnod closeness data
combined_df <- combine_gnod_dfs(df_base, df_new)

}
